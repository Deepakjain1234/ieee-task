                    <h3>'Knowledge shared is knowledge squared”</h3>
                    <p>AARAMBH, as we all know is a Sanskrit word. It means “to begin”,it signifies the inception of
                        something.

                        It is often the case where children hailing from under privileged sections of the society are
                        encountered with the obscurityof how to step into the technologically proliferating world.It is
                        this
                        quandary of “how to begin” that presents itself as the prime impediment.
                        <br>


                        AARAMBH endeavours to bridge the chasm between the under privileged and their access and
                        understanding of science, arising due to economic limitations.
                        <br>

                        It is a social initiative, organised by IEEE MSB, that focuses on encompassing a large number of
                        students across numerous under -resourced schools and acquainting them with the tantalizing
                        mysteries of the world of science. The sole purpose of this event is to instigate an
                        inquisitiveness
                        in the young minds and to introduce them, the wonders that science and technology can achieve.

                    <!-- <h3>'Knowledge shared is knowledge squared”</h3> -->
                    <p>Our country though it produces bright young minds is never able to keep the scintillating flame
                        of inquisitiveness glimmering. The event SCEECS is one such effort to revamp this situation. The
                        reason for organizing SCEECS is to keep alive the blazing inferno of curiosity in the ignited
                        young minds of our nation. <br><br> 

                        To instil the importance of research and to encourage the people to pursue this particular
                        field,IEEE MSB organizes a biennial event called SCEECS. <br>

                        The event lures young trailblazers from across the nation and provides them with an opportunity
                        and a platform to showcase their brilliance, through an a established procedure . It is an
                        ebullient coalescence of technical workshops and guest lectures by prominent personalities and a
                        conference. The main directive of the event is the research paper conference, with a prime
                        objective to create an environment that facilitates research work and promotes researches for
                        the development of our country. <br> <br>

                        This conference helps to publish research papers on IEEE Xplore (congregation of research papers
                        published by scholars from all around the world over several years), providing the people with a
                        plethora from which their research could be well accessed by anyone in the world. IEEE Xlpore
                        acts as an user friendly interface which provides information about any relevant topic at just
                        one finger's click. The papers published through this conference are conveniently available and
                        accessible. Had the papers not been published the world could have been deprived of important
                        research. Felicitating the work , publishing it and uploading it on the world wide web, making
                        it more accessible and portable to anyone in the world is what the conference is about. <br><br>

                        SCCEECS has witnessed a multitude of prominent speakers including Sir David Grinspoon( a NASA
                        scientist) , Sir H.C. Verma , Sir David Meltzer and many more
